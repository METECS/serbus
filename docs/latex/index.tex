Serbus provides basic C A\+P\+Is for the I2\+C and S\+P\+I serial bus protocols on G\+N\+U/\+Linux based systems, as well as a Python package built on top of them.

It\textquotesingle{}s really just a wrapper for the ioctl commands provided by the standard Linux I2\+C and S\+P\+I drivers, so it should be pretty universal. That said, I\textquotesingle{}ve currently only tested it extensively on the Beagle\+Bone Black, so use it at your own risk! (And let me know if it\textquotesingle{}s working for you on another system)
